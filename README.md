# Smith-Brown's example 1
A quick implementation of: **Smith & Brown, 2003** (See [1] below)

This implements the Example 1, that is the case of "Multiple Neurons Driven by a Common Latent Process", from [1].

My code implements an EM Algorithm for decoding based on Point-process observations (Spike train observation, Inter-spike interval observations) using Python 3.

Parameter Estimation of the Kalman filter is implemented using Em Algorithm.

Assessment of the results includes ML and use of Time-Rescaling Theorem.
