# Smith-Brown's example 1
A quick implementation of: Smith & Brown 2003 (See [1] below)

This implements Example 1, "Multiple Neurons Driven by a Common Latent Process", from [1].

It implements an EM Algorithm for decoding based on Point-process observations (Spikes, Inter-spike interval observations).

Parameter Estimation of the Kalman filter is implemented using Em Algorithm.

Assessment of the results includes ML and use of Time-Rescaling Theorem.
